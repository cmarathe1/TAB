dMI-y2eHopS90LBhngHhpA,"Yeah, I know there's a lot of people here. Doesn't mean I don't deserve to be treated like a human BEING. Terrible waitress named Summer. Atleast be nice and respectful. Can't say I'll be coming back.",4,1,female
46T_5Ac7sEta4u3w5BHtPw,"The location of this store is great and I like the convenience of being able to grab a healthy salad if I didn't have time to pack a lunch.  I have always used their online ordering system and I usually request a pick-up time that's 2-3 hours out.  90% of the time the order is not ready when I come to pick it up.  I'm usually told the ""printer isn't working today,"" or sometimes they have the printed order, it just isn't made by the pick up time.    I love the make-your-own salad option.  You can pick your green (I hate lettuce, but love spinach), and up to 5 salad toppings.  There's an additional add-on option if 5 isn't enough.  I've generally had pretty good luck with this, but not today.  I received iceberg and romaine lettuce instead of spinach and two of my toppings were missing.  I did get the sweet potato topping that I had requested, but the potatoes were a weird color and didn't look fresh.  I paid over $10 for this salad that I didn't want to eat.  I called the store (because I didn't have time to go all the way back to the location) and asked if they could just refund back to the card I had used to pay with online.  That seemed to be kind of an ordeal and the manager requested that I call back in 10 minutes.    The employees have always been very nice and they clearly don't set the prices, but corporate needs to send them a printer that works.  And $10 for a salad that's mostly greens with a few of your toppings tossed on top is pricey.  Also, there needs to be some smoother way of refunding to cards.  If you can charge me without the card, you should be able to refund me without the card.    I've been able to overlook the orders not being ready when I get there, but when I still have to wait and the order isn't right, I think I'm done.  I better remember my lunchbox from now on!",2,1,female
bSmRF1xJA11Cc0ygpW0bNg,"Second time here and this time is with my sister. One of the staff is rude and unfriendly and when we sat down and looked at the menu for a minute and she asked if we were ready to order in a disgusting, dirty looked way ... and before I even answer she walked away .. how unprofessional is that? And this waitress is an old lady with makeup on and wear flip flops. I don't think I'll come back here ever again... so unprofessional.",2,1,male
vLQcoBfwGR0uV2G8rmWFZQ,"Less than impressed. The Chinese spiced pork was pretty awful, poor quality, barely spiced and didn't fit, in terms of taste, with the rest of the sandwich ingredients. The star of the sandwich was actually the bread. Service was also quite lackluster.",4,2,male
21rH9QQ-s-2X5TAbuumeNg,"This probably one of the worst places I have had ramen. I was not satisfied with my ramen bowl. I got the Miso lit because I love eating spicy food. It was spicy, but the amount of salt in the broth was unbelieveable. I understand that ramen has a lot of MSG in general, but there is more than just the super salty ramen. The noodles were undercooked. They also did not taste good. The corn was lacking in flavor! And the ramen was all terrible in general. I have been to a lot of ramen places and I have to say I would never coming here again. And definately for not recommend this place.",2,1,male
86pZYp5WNFOZtoLexJnnPg,"We went here our first night in Boston.  If I had to describe it with only one word,  the word would be loud.  The downstairs area was crowded but had a cool vibe.  The upstairs area where we were seated was dark, and apparently hosting one or two very large groups.  Those groups were clearly having a great time, but it was hard for us to enjoy the atmosphere.  The sushi was nothing special.  The best thing I had was the seaweed salad.  The service was lacking; I downed my water within moments of sitting down and did not get a refill the entire time we were there.  Then we had to wait to get the check.  This has to be my biggest restaurant  pet peeve.  The price tag far exceeded the dining experience.  I would not recommend this place to a friend.",4,1,female
kcyT_Kbyux_ce8sz0vOlow,"The interior of the place is pretty cute, gives a vintage feeling. Staff is nice too, but that's about it... Food took forever to arrive and had no flavor. I went with a group of friends and everyone's food was very bland. Usually appetizers like crab Rangoon or scallion pancake are quick to make but we waited 15+ minutes for them to come out. The free egg puffs also took 10+ minutes to make as well... the staff is very friendly though, but the food was a disappointment  I will not be coming back",2,1,male
XwQ_KBDuejc35fx2KgR_vA,"I didn't have a problem with Trinity, but all my friends did.  I went with a bunch of girlfriends and yes, boys tried to hit on us and grind on us on the dancefloor, but I don't know any other dance floor bars where boys don't attempt that.  I liked that it was 3 floors with different music at every floor.  The only problem I have with it was that it had a $10 cover, which is REALLY lame for a bar that's not even fancy or nice.  But it was fun.  But not worth $10!",4,2,female
jDPtxv3kXh4kRL485S-ZJQ,"If you can, treat yourself to an awesome sushi lunch delivered to the office (am doing this - again - today).  A refreshing change from the usual sandwich/pizza grab in a hectic day. Delivery is on time and super friendly.",2,1,female
AhZMKo5nh74gdNvUULK7JA,"When I couldn't find this place and had to call for directions the man who answered stayed on the line with me and helped me navigate my way. He did not hang up until my hand was on the door! I suspect he was the owner because who else would care that much about a random lost lady?  We were in charge of dessert on this particular evening and with the help of Yelp for iPhone, I identified The Boston Chipyard (don't ask why I wasn't also able to find the storefront with that handy device...I concede user error may have played a part.) I ate a whole lot of these petite cookies. And that's not even counting the two dozen we took with us to dinner in Melrose! I love their diminutive size and though they've got many flavors, I say stick with the usual suspects: chocolate chip and peanut butter chocolate chip.",2,1,male
H_u8tbADBTYmchgICjdyWQ,I ordered on grub hub and went in the store. Both times I got a chicken Caesar salad and I got fried. The dressing had a little spicy kick to it which I loved and the chicken was well seasoned. The croutons were a little stale so next time I'll say without but besides that it's good for a little salad lunch.,4,2,female
xoDymKFBrPgUbLrt52hwTQ,"Right idea.  Wrong location?  There's a niche market for their product, and I'm not sure that putting it at the intersection of Huntington and Mass Aves was wise.  As others have commented, the interior needs desterilization and warmth.   If they would make the interior posh, they could persuade customers into thinking they were buying a gourmet product and therefore, silence some of the whining about the price.  This is not about putting lipstick on a pig.  ;-)  The product is great!  This is a packaging issue.  If you can over look the packaging, then you'll appreciate that their ice ""cream"" is made from nut milks - cashew and almond.  Perfect for vegans or lactose intolerant.     Their sorbet is made from soy.  Their cherry vanilla ice ""cream"" is spectacular, and one can barely distinguish theirs from Ben and Jerry's.  Although, Wheeler's version stirs in a liberal amount of cherries; do not expect the texture to be super creamy, this is not dairy.  What you can expect is a smooth texture, and freedom from the disgusting mucus that ordinarily builds in the back of your throat when finished enjoying ice cream.  This is good stuff, worthy of endorsement.  It's surprising that the stars are wide ranging on Yelp, the only thing to do is try it to formulate your own opinion.",2,2,male
cR-6-DFx_rfZbLd5DvnbWQ,"Easy lunch spot for the workweek with great lunch specials. Fresh fish and fast service. The place is really small (mostly a takeout place) and there is only one sushi chef, so order ahead and pick up.",4,1,male
qslxEGD7NZunPMmeVJI1AQ,"Our 25 year old daughter ran her first Boston marathon (2016) and had fun researching restaurants for our 4 night stay. We made a reservation here for the night before the marathon. It was busy and cozy and had a great vibe. I had the steak and avocado salad, husband had burger and daughter the chicken. We were very happy with the whole experience. Be sure to make a reservation since it is a pretty small place.",4,2,male
k9LI1ZDpVigCnYqbDKq1lg,"Quaint, charming restaurant. The food was very good. We had the Salmon dish and a seafood oyster pasta. Both dishes were enjoyable. And the service was great. It's a great place to share a mellow, relaxing meal.",4,2,female
EIwL7IgwU7L5jgolXyNS3A,"A bit cold inside during the winter, but the food was very tasty and it's location is very close to the Garden.",2,2,female
O4WPyQHrmUN_kcBHWBdINA,Food was okay. Where this place goes wrong is on service. Food takes WAY too long to be made. We ordered ahead so we wouldn't have to wait. Our order was supposed to be ready for 7:45 and wasn't ready until almost 8pm. They forgot the bacon on my fianc√©'s burger (which was a $ extra). They also forgot the honey mustard for our chicken nuggets. The portion size on the tater tots is a joke. $5 for this? Such a joke. Will NEVER go back here. Would rather go to Burger King or McDonald's,2,1,female
pNKshYYwn452PCcHEzRY5w,"Bad service and expensive.  The burrito was alright.  The ingredients were good but the burrito was poorly made and rolled.  I told the guy to put guacamole on my burrito and he didn't, reason being because it was going to cost extra.  Lame.  Put guacamole on my burrito if I ask you to.",2,2,male
kaViRU4V0JCla_9oUuH8hQ,"All I'm looking for in a neighborhood pizza place is average food. A pizza that costs $8-10, is ready in 15 minutes and is available at any time of day.  College Pizza hits these marks, but the quality of the food is simply not very good. It's below average pizza, which is unfortunate due to it being so close to my apartment.  Too bad.",2,2,female
BjY8uAo6KKSs3QObja1hfQ,"I've had this kind of Chinese food in other places, none as bad as this one, simply tasteless, should have gone to McDonald's instead. I guess it's because I'm too hungry to make a right choice",4,2,male
hw_-cOMuhockEUuURpkebw,"Bad Lassi. They don't know how to make it.  Disturbingly inconsistent food quality.  This place could be amazing if they would just figure out the days when they're doing things right, rinse, and repeat. Bad, good, then bad again.  Bad Kashmir. Bad.",2,1,female
4eVXnMOvySpSGQitMfsb-A,"Passable Rad Nar with nicely-crunchy ""Chinese broccoli"" though actual Thai people might find the thin fried noodle option to be a little odd as this dish is ordinarily served with wide boiled rice noodle. Glass of Spanish Garnacha was oxidized and old, but was replaced with a glass from a new bottle. Elusive server. Companion's sake glass had a big chip in it.  Quelle average. Interesting menu, though, and might be worth another chance.",4,2,male
CHuxtadcyYh1yXKjHYzURQ,"The food was okay but customer service is terrible. I hate to give a bad review for a Turkish restaurant, but they left out part of our order, and when I called back they said they would refund the difference and never did. Won't go back here again.",4,2,female
YsH7y6Zk77SEddND5FOuuQ,Not great this time.  The social burger was way undercooked versus what i ordered.  the bar drink was $14.50 for a tiny shot of gin.  Tablecloth was dirty from previous guest.   You can spend that kind of money elsewhere for better.,2,2,female
jnvbP0KNd31fjjt4VScsIw,"Overall a solid play. Good chicken pot pie. The service is a little slow, but as expected since it just opened. Overall it kills super salad.",4,1,male
ZEiHfLdwISV-loHW73PtyA,"Found this place because of the cheap beer promotion they had back at the beginning of the summer and started going regularly after work for food, drinks and fun. The bartenders do a great job of getting a drink for you, even if the place is packed. The food is really good too, the nachos, coogan bbq burger, flat bread pizzas and spinach artichoke dip are all really good, and I am still venturing out for the other parts of the menu which are probably just as good. They have a really good karaoke on wednesday where some people put on a pretty good show. The karaoke dj is also pretty talented herself and usually sings a few songs. They also have stump trivia which is fun and great with a group after work. Fridays and saturdays are fun too, the place usually gets pretty packed, but still is a good time. And I've been there a few times where the opened up the additional space for a dance floor and they've had a few good dj's that was awesome at mixing up different songs.",4,1,male
9HWfJV_7RbiKiYi-0S2CUQ,"This place has friggin' awesome food. The pizza slices are enormous! Good prices too. I would definitely come here once a week at least if I was downtown more often. As an added bonus, they gave out free samples of some supremely delicious pork sandwich (haul). +1 star for free samples...always.",2,1,male
F_dbfkpq97w-qZZKxDuLfQ,This is a great lunch cart. The veggies are fresh and the chicken is usually super moist and very well seasoned. I recommend the pita pocket...,4,2,female
5sy-lkNavM4gJ0e7bf46Rg,"I was working around the corner and stopped in for a coffee.  Ordered a coffee and decided to get poppyseed muffin.  Coffee and the muffin were great.  Nice decor semi-industrial but spacious and well lit.  Lots of tables, nice layout and a great coffee atmosphere.  Seems like a nice place to meet for coffee.",4,1,male
Pm3PsfvF81dbiZJBNfPBkQ,"Ordered for take out.  Montecristo crepe was good, but the goat cheese could have been spread more consistently. It was also really thin which isn't too surprising cause it's just ham, egg, and cheese but it leaves me wanting more.   Overall, crepe was tasty but I wouldn't order it again. The avocado crostini my gf ordered on the other hand was way better and worthy.",4,1,male
f9AaYIyO6YxCPI4b7lNdCQ,"I wanted Szechuan for dinner tonight so Yelp led us to Five Spices House. Surprisingly unbusy for 7pm on a weeknight, there was only one other table occupied upstairs when we were seated.  Service was fine and attentive. All of the food pretty much came out all at once, no real appetizer time which worked out okay but may be a thing for others.  We got a bunch of stuff. Typical eyes bigger than belly, but we managed to eat nearly all of it.  Dan Dan Noodles were good. Noodles were perfect and the sauce had the right consistency, it just wasn't as spicy as I wanted.   Sizzling Beef. Excellent. Lots of beef, lots of flavor. Very nicely done.  Shrimp Lo Mein. Shrimp were perfectly deveined and shell removed. Very tasty noodles with the right amount of crisp veggies.  Crap Rangoon. Nice and hot, nicely stuffed. General Gau's Chicken. Batter was too thick and the sauce too sweet.  We enjoyed our Szechuan outing. Delicious!",2,2,female
Mu3cXVNPEOGtAKcadA1n4w,"A good place for those seeking authentic Mexican fare--and yes, it costs a bit more, but this is not your standard burrito joint. Pescado a la veracruzana was a generous portion of cod smothered in a delicious tomato-olive sauce; and the camarones al chipotle--with a cream-based sauce laced with smoky chilies--were very good. Guacamole tasted fresh and went well with a round of tart, refreshing magaritas. I've traveled to Mexico several times and this is one of Boston's better attempts at replicating some memorable recipes,",2,2,female
